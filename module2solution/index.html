                <p id="chicago-title" class="city-title">Chicago</p>
                <p class="citydesc">A fun city with a lot to do, has beautiful summers but brutal winters.
                    Famous for its deep-dish pizza and mustard hot dogs. The public transit is provided by CTA, which operates cute trains running 
                    between high-rise buildings in the downtown area (known as the Loop). A prominent landmark of the city is Lake Michigan: Downtown Chicago as well as 
                    the main campuses of the University of Chicago and Northwestern University are situated right on the lakefront. Chicago is quite segregated and
                    some portions of the South and West Sides are not a safe place to visit for tourists.

            <div id="box2" class="city">
                <p id="newyork-title" class="city-title">New York</p>
                <p class="citydesc">The largest city in the nation, New York consists of five boroughs and is home to almost 9 million people from a big variety of ethnic backgrounds - just one 
                    neighborhood in Queens has speakers of 160 languages living there!
                    Manhattan is the densest borough, Queens is the largest in area, Brooklyn is the most populated one, the Bronx has the largest parks and Staten Island is the most
                    suburban one. The city has endured a lot of hardships in the last fifty years: financial crisis of the 1970-80s devastating multiple neighborhoods, 
                    Twin Towers attacks on 9/11, Hurricane Sandy and an extremely deadly Covid outbreak in spring 2020. 
                    New York City is served by three airports: JFK in Queens, LaGuardia in Queens (named after a former mayor) and Newark Airport in a New Jersey suburb.
                    The borough of Manhattan and some New Jersey suburbs are some of the most densely populated places in the world.

                <p id="austin-title" class="city-title">Austin</p>
                <p class="citydesc">Austin is the capital of Texas, and its Capitol building is bigger than the one in Washington DC. Despite occupying as much area as New York City, Austin's population 
                    is less than one million &mdash; even though it's been rapidly growing. The city's most famous college, University of Texas, has its main campus near the downtown area. 
                    Austin has one municipal airport, one commuter rail line and many bus routes. The city hosts some well-known music festivals like SXSW and Austin City Limits and is famous for its Tex-Mex food, as well as plentiful
                    parks and green spaces. The closest other major city is San Antonio.
